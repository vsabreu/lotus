### Why "Lotus"?
As the proposed problem involves racing and karts, I was inspired by old memories from watching F1 races on television. My favorite cars were the Lotus, that's why the name. As a coincidence, Lotus 72 was also considered one of the best F1 cars ever, giving this application an even more special shine!
